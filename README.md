# eveline

eveline is a library that allows you to create an ecosystem on any supported machine, manage it, customize it, and extract arguments for further work for any purpose.

The eveline library provides both controlled and completely random ecosystem development. Since an ecosystem is essentially evolving chaos, the library can be used for cryptographic purposes to create random keys, hashes, bytes, etc.
